Sickbeard + XBMC Watched Status Integration
=====

The idea behind this fork is to more closely integrate Sickbeard with XMBC, by providing XMBC watched statuses on the various pages of Sickbeard , so you can quickly see which episodes you have watched, directly from Sickbeard !

The query interface is pretty much complete (sans possible XBMC API) , but a lot of stuff is hard coded and will need a new options page to handle a lot of settings.

FUTURE TODOS:

1. Add settings page for server settings, etc

2. Allow user to mark an episode as watched/unwatched directly from sickbeard

3. Support XBMC API for queries
